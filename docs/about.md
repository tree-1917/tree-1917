# About Me 🐫💎

Welcome to the digital caravan of **Gamal Moussa**. I am a Linux Architect and Backend Engineer passionate about building resilient, optimized, and high-performance systems.

### 🏜️ My Journey
This space is more than a blog; it's a living repository of my explorations through the vast deserts of **System Administration** and **Software Engineering**. I believe in the power of open-source and the relentless pursuit of technical excellence.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
My work focuses on the core pillars of modern computing:

*   **Linux Mastery**: Advanced administration, kernel tuning, and hardcore troubleshooting.
*   **Backend Craftsmanship**: Architecting robust APIs with **Python** (FastAPI, Flask, Django).
*   **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Command over **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Nginx**, and secure networking (VPNs, Subnetting).
*   **Automation**: Streamlining complexity with **Shell Scripting** and efficient workflows.

### 📜 What You'll Find Here
I distill my hands-on experiences into "scrolls" of knowledge:
- Deep dives into system internals.
- Practical guides for modern developer tools.
- Real-world project post-mortems and scripts.
