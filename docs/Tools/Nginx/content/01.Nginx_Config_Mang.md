## 1. Introduction to Nginx 🖥️

**Nginx** is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. Whether you're serving static content, managing multiple domains, or handling high traffic loads, Nginx is a versatile tool in your web infrastructure arsenal.

---

## 2. Levels of **Nginx Configuration** 🏗️

Nginx configurations are organized into hierarchical contexts, each serving a specific purpose. Understanding these levels is crucial for effective management.

### 🌐 Configuration Hierarchy

1. **Main Context**: Defines global settings applicable to the entire Nginx instance.
2. **Events Context**: Manages connection processing and networking.
3. **HTTP Context**: Configures settings for handling HTTP traffic.
4. **Server Context**: Defines virtual hosts for handling different domains.
5. **Location Context**: Specifies how Nginx should process specific request URIs.

---

## 3. Key Directives in **Nginx Configuration** 🔧

Certain directives are fundamental to Nginx's operation. Here's a breakdown:

| **Directive**        | **Description**                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`               | Specifies the user and group Nginx will run as. 🧑‍💻                                     |
| `worker_processes`   | Sets the number of worker processes. Usually set to `auto` for optimal performance. ⚙️ |
| `worker_connections` | Defines the maximum number of simultaneous connections per worker. 🔗                  |
| `http`               | Encloses all HTTP-related configurations. 🌐                                           |

## 4. Understanding **Worker_Processes** and **worker_connections** 🛠️

Optimizing these settings ensures Nginx can handle the desired number of clients efficiently.

### 📊 Calculation Formula

```
max_clients = worker_processes * worker_connections
```

- **`worker_processes`**: Number of worker processes. Setting this to `auto` allows Nginx to adjust based on available CPU cores.
- **`worker_connections`**: Maximum number of connections each worker can handle.

**Example:**
If `worker_processes` is set to `4` and `worker_connections` to `1024`, then:

```
max_clients = 4 * 1024 = 4096
```

---

## 5. Configuring Error and Access Logging 📝

Proper logging is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 📂 Log Types

- **Access Log**: Records all client requests.
- **Error Log**: Captures server errors and diagnostic information.

### 🔧 Configuration Example

```nginx
http {
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
}
```

---

## 6. Document Root and Permissions 📁🔒

Setting the correct document root and permissions ensures your web content is served securely and efficiently.

### 🖥️ Server Block Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;
}
```

### 🔐 Setting Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ownership**: Assigns ownership to the `nginx` user and group.
- **Permissions**: Sets read and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.

---

## 7. Managing `index.html` and 404 Error Pages 📄🚫

Customizing your `index.html` and error pages enhances user experience.

### 🗂️ Configuration Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;

    # Custom 404 Page
    error_page 404 /404.html;
    location = /404.html {
        root /var/www/html;
        internal;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`index` Directive**: Specifies the default file to serve.
- **`error_page` Directive**: Defines a custom page for 404 errors.
- **`location` Block**: Serves the custom 404 page internally.

---

## 8. Testing Your Web Server 🧪🌍

Ensuring your Nginx setup works correctly is vital before going live.

### 🔍 Methods to Test

1. **Using a Web Browser**

   - Navigate to `http://example.com` and `http://test.com`.
   - Verify the display of respective `index.html` pages.

2. **Using `curl`**

   ```bash
   # Test the main page
   curl -I http://example.com

   # Test a non-existent page to trigger 404
   curl -I http://example.com/nonexistentpage
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   - **200 OK** for existing pages.
   - **404 Not Found** for non-existent pages.

---

## 9. Managing Virtual Hosts (**Server Blocks**) 🏠🌐

Virtual Hosts allow Nginx to serve multiple websites from a single server.

### 🔧 Configuration Example

```nginx
# Server Block for example.com
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example;
    index index.html;
}

# Server Block for test.com
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name test.com;
    root /var/www/test;
    index index.html;
}
```

### 📌 Name-Based Virtual Hosting

This method uses the `server_name` directive to differentiate between domains sharing the same IP address.

---

## 10. Production vs. Development Configurations 🏭🛠️

Different environments require tailored Nginx settings for optimal performance and debugging.

### 🏭 For Production

- **Caching & Compression**: Enhance performance.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure your websites with HTTPS.

**Example:**

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_cache my_cache;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 1h;
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;
}
```

### 🛠️ For Development

- **Enhanced Logging**: Facilitate debugging with verbose logs.

**Example:**

```nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/dev_error.log debug;
```

---

## 11. URL Rewriting and Redirection 🔄🔗

Manipulating URLs helps in maintaining SEO, redirecting old URLs, or restructuring site architecture.

### 🔄 Rewriting URLs

```nginx
rewrite ^/oldpage$ /newpage permanent;
```

**Explanation:** Redirects requests from `/oldpage` to `/newpage` with a permanent (301) redirect.

### 🔗 Redirecting Domains

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name oldsite.com;
    return 301 http://newsite.com$request_uri;
}
```

**Explanation:** Redirects all traffic from `oldsite.com` to `newsite.com`, preserving the original request URI.

## 🛠️ Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Always Test Configurations**: Before reloading Nginx, use `sudo nginx -t` to check for syntax errors.
- **Use Separate Configuration Files**: Organize server blocks in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and enable them via symbolic links in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.
- **Regularly Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on access and error logs to proactively address issues.
- **Keep Nginx Updated**: Ensure you're running the latest stable version for security and performance improvements.
