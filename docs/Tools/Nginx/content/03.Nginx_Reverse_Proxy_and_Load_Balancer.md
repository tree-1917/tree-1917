## Reverse Proxy vs. Forward Proxy üîÑ

| Feature               | Reverse Proxy                                               | Forward Proxy                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | Acts on behalf of backend servers, handling client requests | Acts on behalf of clients, accessing external servers |
| **Use Case**          | Load balancing, security, and caching                       | Bypassing restrictions and maintaining anonymity      |
| **Traffic Direction** | Client ‚Üí Reverse Proxy ‚Üí Backend Server                     | Client ‚Üí Forward Proxy ‚Üí Internet                     |

### What is a Reverse Proxy?

- A **reverse proxy** forwards client requests to one or more backend servers, effectively hiding the server's details from clients.

### What is a Forward Proxy?

- A **forward proxy** serves as an intermediary for clients requesting resources from the internet, masking their identities.

## Key Benefits of Using a Reverse Proxy üåü

| Benefit                                   | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Load Balancing**                        | Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers        |
| **Improved Security and Anonymity**       | Hides backend server information, enhancing security       |
| **SSL Terminations**                      | Manages SSL/TLS encryption and decryption                  |
| **Caching for Better Performance**        | Stores frequently accessed resources for quicker responses |
| **Compression**                           | Reduces the size of data transmitted to clients            |

## Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy üõ†Ô∏è

To set up Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can use the following directives in your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;  # Listen on port 80
    server_name yourdomain.com;  # Your domain name

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server;  # Specify the backend server
        proxy_set_header Host $host;        # Set the Host header
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;  # Pass client IP
        proxy_connect_timeout 60;            # Connection timeout
        proxy_read_timeout 120;              # Read timeout
    }
}
```

### Example Configuration

Suppose you have a backend server running at `http://192.168.1.100:5000`. Your Nginx configuration might look like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mywebsite.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_connect_timeout 60;
        proxy_read_timeout 120;
    }
}
```

## Understanding Load Balancing ‚öñÔ∏è

Load balancing involves distributing network traffic across multiple servers. This process helps prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring better performance and reliability.

### Types of Load Balancing Algorithms:

- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly across servers.
- **Least Connections**: Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Ensures requests from the same client IP go to the same server.
- **Weighted Load Balancing**: Assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity.
- **Least Time**: Routes traffic to the server with the lowest response time.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors server health to ensure requests are only sent to healthy servers.

---

## Configuring Nginx as a Load Balancer ‚öôÔ∏è

### Round Robin

- **Description**: Default method that distributes requests evenly.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
}
```

### Least Connections

- **Description**: Routes traffic to the server with the least active connections.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
}
```

### IP Hash

- **Description**: Ensures the same client IP is routed to the same server.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    ip_hash;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
}
```

### Weighted Load Balancing

- **Description**: Assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com weight=3;  # More capacity
    server backend2.example.com weight=1;  # Less capacity
}
```

### Least Time

- **Description**: Routes traffic to the server with the lowest average response time.

```nginx
upstream backend {
    least_time;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
}
```

### Health Checks

- **Description**: Ensures requests are sent only to healthy servers.
  - **Passive Health Checks**: Monitors server health based on response status.
  - **Active Health Checks**: Periodically sends requests to verify server health.

## Practical Example: Setting Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### 2. Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy with Load Balancing

Edit the Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) and add the following configuration:

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name mywebsite.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_connect_timeout 60;
            proxy_read_timeout 120;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Test Configuration

Before applying changes, ensure the configuration is correct:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### 4. Reload Nginx

Apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 5. Monitor Traffic

To visualize how traffic is distributed across servers, you can use monitoring tools like Grafana or simple logging in Nginx.
