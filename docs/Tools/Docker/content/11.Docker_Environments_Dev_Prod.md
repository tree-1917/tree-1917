## How to Run Docker with More than One Environment (Production and Development)?

### 1. Introduction to Multi-Environment Setup 🌟

When developing and deploying applications, it's crucial to maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production. This allows developers to experiment in development while ensuring stability in production.

### 2. Why Use Multiple Environments? 💡

- **Development**: Allows testing new features without affecting end users.
- **Production**: Stable environment optimized for performance and security.
- **Staging/Testing**: Optional environment to simulate production before deploying changes.

### 3. Creating Docker Compose Files for Each Environment 📂

#### Base Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) 📄

This file contains the common configurations for your services. It can include shared services like databases.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=base
    networks:
      - mynetwork

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass
    networks:
      - mynetwork

networks:
  mynetwork:
```

#### Production Config (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) ⚙️

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=production
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
    networks:
      - mynetwork

networks:
  mynetwork:
```

#### Development Config (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) 🛠️

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=development
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    command: npm run dev
    networks:
      - mynetwork

networks:
  mynetwork:
```

### 4. Switching Between Environments 🔀

You can easily switch between environments by combining the base file with the appropriate environment-specific file.

- **Production**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
  ```

- **Development**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
  ```

These commands override the base configurations with environment-specific settings.

### 5. Practical Example 🧑‍💻

Here’s a scenario to show how you can switch between environments effectively:

| Environment     | Command                                                                 | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` | Runs the services with production settings. Ports are mapped to `80:80`.    |
| **Development** | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`  | Runs the services in development mode. Hot reloading and `8080:80` mapping. |

### 6. Best Practices for Managing Environments 🛡️

1. **Use `.env` files for secrets** 🔑  
   Store sensitive information such as database passwords in an `.env` file, which can be referenced in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
     - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
   ```

2. **Use Version Control for Docker Compose Files** 📂  
   Keep separate `docker-compose` files for each environment under version control so they can be reviewed and shared easily among teams.

3. **Use a Staging Environment for Testing** 📋  
   Before deploying to production, consider running a staging environment using another Docker Compose file, such as `docker-compose.staging.yml`.

### 7. Visual Overview 🌐

Create a flowchart or diagram to illustrate how Docker uses different Compose files to configure environments. This could show the following steps:

- Docker uses `docker-compose.yml` as the base.
- It applies overrides from environment-specific files like `docker-compose.prod.yml` or `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- The final container configuration is launched based on the merged setup.
