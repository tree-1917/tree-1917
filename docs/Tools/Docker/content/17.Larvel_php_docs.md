## 🔧 **Step 1: Install PHP with Laravel Sail**

Laravel Sail simplifies the setup of a PHP environment with Docker. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. **Open Your Terminal** 🖥️

Navigate to the directory where you want to install your Laravel application:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/projects
```

### 2. **Run the Laravel Sail Installation Command** 🚀

Execute the following command to create a new Laravel project with MySQL and Redis:

```bash
sudo curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app?with=mysql,redis" | sudo bash
```

> **📌 Note:** Replace `example-app` with your desired project name.

### 3. **Project Structure Overview** 📂

After running the command, your project directory will look like this:

```
example-app/
├── app/
├── bootstrap/
├── config/
├── database/
├── docker/
├── public/
├── resources/
├── routes/
├── storage/
├── tests/
├── vendor/
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yml
├── composer.json
└── ...
```

### 4. **Navigate into the Project Folder** 📁

```bash
cd example-app
```

### 5. **Start the Application with Docker** 🐳

Run the following command to start all necessary Docker containers:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

> **💡 Tip:** To run containers in the background, use:
>
> ```bash
> ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
> ```

---

## 🔍 **Step 2: Verify the Setup**

Ensure everything is set up correctly by accessing your Laravel application.

1. **Open Your Web Browser** 🌐
2. **Visit `http://localhost`**

You should see the **Laravel Welcome Page**, indicating that PHP and other services are running successfully.

---

## 🏃‍♂️ **Step 3: Running PHP with Docker**

Now that your environment is set up, here's how to manage your PHP application using Docker:

### **Starting Containers**

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

### **Stopping Containers**

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail down
```

### **Checking Container Status** 👀

```bash
docker ps
```

### **Example Commands Table** 📋

| **Action**                     | **Command**                 | **Description**                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Start containers               | `./vendor/bin/sail up`      | Launches all Docker containers     |
| Start containers in background | `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`   | Runs containers in detached mode   |
| Stop containers                | `./vendor/bin/sail down`    | Stops and removes containers       |
| View running containers        | `docker ps`                 | Lists all active Docker containers |
| Restart containers             | `./vendor/bin/sail restart` | Restarts all Docker containers     |

## 🔄 **Managing Docker Services**

Laravel Sail provides straightforward commands to manage your Docker services efficiently.

### **Common Docker Commands with Sail** 🔧

| **Service**                    | **Command**                                  | **Description**                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Start all services             | `./vendor/bin/sail up`                       | Starts all Docker containers             |
| Start services in background   | `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`                    | Runs containers in detached mode         |
| Stop all services              | `./vendor/bin/sail down`                     | Stops and removes all containers         |
| Rebuild services               | `./vendor/bin/sail build`                    | Rebuilds Docker images                   |
| Execute a command in a service | `./vendor/bin/sail exec <service> <command>` | Runs a command inside a specific service |

> **📌 Example:** To execute Artisan commands:
>
> ```bash
> ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
> ```

## 🐳 **Understanding Docker PHP Environment**

Your Laravel application runs within a Dockerized PHP environment, which ensures consistency across different development and production setups.

### **Key Components** 🛠️

| **Component**       | **Description**                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **PHP Container**   | Runs the PHP application with necessary extensions. |
| **MySQL Container** | Manages the MySQL database service.                 |
| **Redis Container** | Handles Redis caching service.                      |
| **Nginx Container** | Serves the application via the Nginx web server.    |

### **Docker Compose File** 📄

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines and configures these services. Here's a simplified view:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  laravel.test:
    build:
      context: ./docker/8.3
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        WWWGROUP: '${WWWGROUP}'
    image: sail-8.3/app
    ports:
      - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
    environment:
      WWWUSER: '${WWWUSER}'
      ...
    volumes:
      - '.:/var/www/html'
    networks:
      - sail
  mysql:
    image: 'mysql:8.0'
    ports:
      - '${FORWARD_DB_PORT:-3306}:3306'
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: '${DB_PASSWORD}'
      ...
    volumes:
      - 'sailmysql:/var/lib/mysql'
    networks:
      - sail
  redis:
    image: 'redis:alpine'
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    networks:
      - sail

networks:
  sail:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  sailmysql:
    driver: local
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### **1. Docker Containers Not Starting** 🚫

- **Check Docker Status:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **Restart Docker:**
  Sometimes restarting Docker resolves startup issues.

### **2. Port Conflicts** ⚠️

- **Identify Conflicting Services:**
  Ensure no other services are running on the same ports defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Change Port Configuration:**
  Modify the `APP_PORT` or other port variables in your `.env` file.

### **3. Permission Issues** 🔒

- **Set Correct Permissions:**
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
  ```
- **Avoid Using `sudo` with Sail:**
  Running Sail commands without `sudo` is recommended to prevent permission conflicts.

### **4. Missing Dependencies** ❓

- **Install Required PHP Extensions:**
  Modify the `Dockerfile` to include necessary extensions and rebuild the containers:
  ```bash
  ./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache
  ```

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

By leveraging Laravel Sail and Docker, you can effortlessly set up a robust PHP development environment complete with MySQL and Redis. This setup ensures consistency, scalability, and ease of management across different stages of development and deployment.
