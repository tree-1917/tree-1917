# Overview of Algorithms and Data Structures 🚀

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science. They help us solve problems efficiently and manage data effectively. Let's explore these concepts using emojis! 🌟

## 📚 Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task. Think of it as a recipe in a cookbook. Here are some common types of algorithms:

### Sorting Algorithms 📈

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a particular order. Examples include:

- **Bubble Sort** 🧼
- **Quick Sort** ⚡
- **Merge Sort** 🔗

```text
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6] -> [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
  (Unsorted)            (Sorted)
```
### Searching Algorithms 🔍

Searching algorithms help you find specific data within a collection. Examples include:

- **Binary Search** 🔢
- **Linear Search** 🔄

```text
Target: 7
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
             ^
           Found!
```
## 🗂️ Data Structures

A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data for efficient access and modification. Here are some common data structures:

### Arrays 📊

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

```text
Index:  0   1   2   3
Value: [A] [B] [C] [D]
```
### Linked Lists 🔗

A linked list is a linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next one.

```text
[Head] -> [Node A] -> [Node B] -> [Node C] -> NULL
```
### Stacks 📚

A stack follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Think of it as a stack of plates where you add or remove plates from the top.

```text
|   C   |  <-- Top (Push/Pop)
|   B   |
|___A___|
```
### Queues 🕰️

A queue follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Imagine a line at a checkout where the first person in line is the first to be served.

```text
Enqueue -> [D] [C] [B] [A] -> Dequeue
```
### Trees 🌳

Trees are hierarchical structures where each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes (its children).

```text
      (Root)
      /    \
  (Child) (Child)
   /   \
(Leaf) (Leaf)
```
### Graphs 📈

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. They can represent networks, such as social connections or paths in a map.

```text
(A) --- (B)
 |       |
(C) --- (D)
 \_____/
```
## 🔄 Complexity Analysis

Understanding the **time** and **space complexity** of algorithms helps us choose the most efficient one for our needs.

- **Big O Notation** 🅾️
- **Big Ω Notation** 🅾️
- **Big Θ Notation** 🅾️

```text
O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2)
(Good) ----------------------------> (Bad)
```
